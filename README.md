# 🌍 Global Population Dynamics: An Exploratory Data Analysis (1970–2022)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project conducts a **comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on global population data spanning over **five decades (1970–2022)**.  
The goal is to uncover **trends in population growth, density, regional disparities, and demographic shifts** across continents and countries.  

Through **data visualization and statistical exploration**, this project transforms raw population statistics into **actionable insights** for policymakers, researchers, and global organizations.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. 📈 Analyze **global population growth patterns** from 1970 to 2022.  
2. 🌎 Compare **population density and growth rates** across continents and countries.  
3. 🔍 Identify the **most and least populated regions** in 2022.  
4. ⚖️ Examine relationships between **area, density, and growth rate**.  
5. 📊 Visualize **key demographic transitions and long-term trends**.
