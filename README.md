**🌍 Global Population Dynamics: An Exploratory Data Analysis (1970–2022)**
**📌Project Overview:-** This project conducts a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on global population data spanning over five decades (1970–2022). The analysis uncovers trends in population growth, density, regional disparities, and demographic shifts across continents and countries. Through data visualization and statistical exploration, this project transforms raw population statistics into actionable insights for policymakers, researchers, and global organizations.

**🎯 Objectives:-**
1. Analyze global population growth patterns from 1970 to 2022.
2. Compare population density and growth rates across continents and countries.
3. Identify the most and least populated regions in 2022.
4. Examine relationships between area, density, and growth rate.
5. Visualize key demographic transitions and trends.

**📊 Dataset:-** The dataset used in this analysis is world_population.csv, which contains:
1. 234 countries/territories
2. 17 columns including:
   a. Population data for years: 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2015, 2020, 2022
   b. Continent, capital, area, density, and growth rate
   c. World population percentage

**🛠️ Tools & Libraries**
1. Python 3
2. Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis.
3. NumPy – Numerical computations.
4. Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization.
5. Plotly – Interactive plots.

**📈 Key Insights**
1. Asia and Africa have experienced the highest population growth since 1970.
2. Europe and North America show slower or stagnant growth trends.
3. Population density correlates strongly with urbanization and economic development.
4. Emerging demographic trends highlight the need for sustainable resource planning and policy-making.
